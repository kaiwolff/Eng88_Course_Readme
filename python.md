# Python

## 1. Data Types

Important to remember that data types sometimes need to be forced into being a particular type. input is a string by default, so if taking in an integer 9for example), it needs to be forced into this form using the `int()` method.

## 2. Operators

#### Arithmetic Operators:
| Operand | Description | Example |
|:---------: |:----------------------------: |:--------: |
| + | add two operands (variables) together| X + y + 2 |
| - | subtract two operands (variables) | X - y - 2 |
| * | multiply two operands (variables) | X * y|
| / | divide two operands (variables) | X / y |
| % | Modulus - remainder of the division of left operand by the right | X % y |

#### Comparison Operators:

| Operand | Description | Example |
|:---------: |:----------------------------: |:--------: |
| > | True if left operand is greater than the right| x > y |
| < | True if left operand is less than the right| x < y |
| == | True if both operands are equal | x == y |
| != | True if both operands are equal | x != y |
| >= | True if left operand is greater than or equal to the right| x >= y |
| <= | True if left operand is less than or equal to the right| x <= y |


## 3. Functions

These are blocks of code that do something you may want to call on again. Generally functions should do one thing, and do it well.

Important part of DRY principle DON'T REPEAT YOURSELF. If you can put something into a function and re-use it, you absolutely should.

Syntax for creating a function is `def name():`. The functions can also be put into classes, where they are called methods.

Functions can be used to take in 'arguments', that they then manipulate and
