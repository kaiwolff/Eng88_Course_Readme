# Python

## 1. Data Types

Important to remember that data types sometimes need to be forced into being a particular type. input is a string by default, so if taking in an integer 9for example), it needs to be forced into this form using the `int()` method.

## 2. Operators

#### Arithmetic Operators:
| Operand | Description | Example |
|:---------: |:----------------------------: |:--------: |
| + | add two operands (variables) together| X + y + 2 |
| - | subtract two operands (variables) | X - y - 2 |
| * | multiply two operands (variables) | X * y|
| / | divide two operands (variables) | X / y |
| % | Modulus - remainder of the division of left operand by the right | X % y |

#### Comparison Operators:

| Operand | Description | Example |
|:---------: |:----------------------------: |:--------: |
| > | True if left operand is greater than the right| x > y |
| < | True if left operand is less than the right| x < y |
| == | True if both operands are equal | x == y |
| != | True if both operands are equal | x != y |
| >= | True if left operand is greater than or equal to the right| x >= y |
| <= | True if left operand is less than or equal to the right| x <= y |
